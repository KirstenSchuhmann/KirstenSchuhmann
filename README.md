## About me

Hello there, 
I'm Kirsten, the creative head of this GitHub Profile 👋

Lately I've been focused to create awesome designs in Figma and exploring the World of UX/UI Design, but before that I took the opportunity to understand the crucial parts of Web Development. 

## Projects
In my repositories, you'll find some projects from my web development bootcamp with [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de). Please keep in mind, that most of them have been projects to practice my web-dev skills, so they are not fully developed and might have some bugs 🐞
